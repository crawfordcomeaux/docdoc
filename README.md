DoC Doc
=======

DoC Doc is a deck and game analysis tool for Might &amp; Magic: Duel of Champions.

This is the initial project for what will hopefully be a community-built client-server app that will ideally:

1. Use players' replay files to analyze game/deck
2. Store game data locally
3. Give per-turn probabilities for cards in decks
4. Generate random first hands & mulligans
5. Upload players' game data to server to maintain game history beyond replay file changes and reinstalls
6. Track card/deck usage across community via data on server
